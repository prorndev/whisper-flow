## Plan Phase Complete
**Date**: сре, 11. јун 2025.  04:55:07 CEST

### Plan Summary
A comprehensive refactoring plan has been developed that addresses all requirements for the Level 3 task. The plan includes:

- Detailed requirements analysis
- Component breakdown and responsibilities
- Proposed architecture and design patterns
- Implementation strategy and phases
- Dependencies and challenge mitigations
- Creative design requirements

### Next Steps
Transitioning to CREATIVE mode to make key design decisions for:

1. Configuration system design
2. Component communication architecture
3. Threading model and concurrency approach

**Mode Transition: PLAN → CREATIVE**

## Creative Phase Complete
**Status**: DESIGN COMPLETE

### Architectural Decisions
- **Configuration**: Finalized YAML + Pydantic approach.
- **Communication**: Selected Event Bus (Pub/Sub) architecture.
- **Threading**: Chose `ThreadPoolExecutor` for task management.

### Implementation Readiness
- The architectural blueprint is complete and documented.
- All major design decisions have been resolved.
- Ready to begin implementation phase.

**Status Update**: Creative design complete. Ready for IMPLEMENT mode transition.
