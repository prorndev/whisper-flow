# WhisperFlow Refactoring - Implementation Strategy

## Phase 1: Configuration System
1. Create configuration file structure (YAML-based)
2. Extract all constants and settings to config
3. Implement configuration manager with validation
4. Update code to reference configuration

## Phase 2: Core Architecture
1. Define base class structures and interfaces
2. Implement dependency injection framework
3. Create application lifecycle management
4. Set up logging and error handling system

## Phase 3: Service Implementation
1. Refactor each component into appropriate classes
2. Implement proper encapsulation and inheritance
3. Apply identified design patterns
4. Create unit tests for services

## Phase 4: Integration and Orchestration
1. Connect all components through well-defined interfaces
2. Implement event system for component communication
3. Create proper initialization and shutdown sequences
4. Ensure thread safety and resource management

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Project Structure Setup
- Create directory structure as outlined
- Set up base package files and imports
- Create initial configuration file template

### Step 2: Configuration System
- Implement ConfigManager class
- Extract all hardcoded values to config.yaml
- Create default configuration fallbacks
- Add configuration validation

### Step 3: Core Services Refactoring
- Refactor SpotifyControl into proper service
- Implement AudioRecorder and AudioProcessor classes
- Create TranscriptionService with proper abstraction
- Develop InputManager for hotkey handling

### Step 4: Platform Abstraction
- Create PlatformService for environment detection
- Implement platform-specific strategy classes
- Build platform factory for runtime selection

### Step 5: Application Orchestration
- Develop Application class to orchestrate components
- Implement proper lifecycle management
- Create event system for component communication
- Ensure proper error handling and recovery

### Step 6: Integration and Testing
- Connect all components through interfaces
- Verify all functionality works as expected
- Perform thorough testing of edge cases
- Optimize performance where needed
