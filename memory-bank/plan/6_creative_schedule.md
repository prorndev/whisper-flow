# WhisperFlow Refactoring - Creative Phase Components

## Components Requiring Creative Design

1. **Configuration System Design**
   - Format and structure of configuration file
   - Validation and error handling approach
   - Default value management

2. **Component Communication Architecture**
   - Event system vs direct method calls
   - Synchronous vs asynchronous communication
   - Error propagation strategy

3. **Threading Model**
   - Thread pool vs dedicated threads
   - Concurrency control mechanisms
   - Resource sharing approach

## Implementation Schedule

### Phase 1: Foundation (1-2 days)
- Project structure setup
- Configuration system implementation
- Base interfaces and abstract classes

### Phase 2: Core Components (2-3 days)
- Audio recording and processing
- Transcription service
- Input and output handling

### Phase 3: Integration (1-2 days)
- Component orchestration
- Thread management
- Error handling and recovery

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement (1 day)
- Comprehensive testing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation and comments

## Conclusion and Next Steps

This refactoring plan provides a comprehensive approach to restructuring the WhisperFlow application according to best practices in software engineering. The plan addresses all requirements including Single Responsibility Principle, Object-Oriented Programming, and proper configuration management.

### Next Steps
1. Proceed to CREATIVE phase to make key design decisions
2. Implement configuration system as foundation
3. Refactor components incrementally while maintaining functionality
4. Test thoroughly to ensure behavior consistency

**Mode Transition Recommendation: CREATIVE**
