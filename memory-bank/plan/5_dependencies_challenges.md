# WhisperFlow Refactoring - Dependencies & Challenges

## Key Dependencies
- Core Application ← Configuration System
- Audio Recording ← Platform Detection
- Transcription ← Audio Recording
- Output Handling ← Transcription, Platform Detection
- Hotkey Management ← Application Core
- Spotify Integration ← Audio Recording

## Critical Integration Points
- Configuration loading and validation
- Platform-specific functionality selection
- Threading and concurrency management
- Error handling and recovery
- Resource acquisition and cleanup

## Challenges & Mitigations

### Challenge: Maintaining Thread Safety
**Mitigation:** Implement proper thread synchronization, use thread-safe queues for data passing, minimize shared state

### Challenge: Platform Compatibility
**Mitigation:** Abstract platform-specific code behind interfaces, use runtime detection and strategy pattern

### Challenge: Resource Management
**Mitigation:** Implement proper cleanup routines, use context managers, ensure exception safety

### Challenge: Configuration Complexity
**Mitigation:** Provide sensible defaults, implement validation, use hierarchical configuration

### Challenge: Preserving Performance
**Mitigation:** Profile before and after, optimize critical paths, maintain GPU acceleration
